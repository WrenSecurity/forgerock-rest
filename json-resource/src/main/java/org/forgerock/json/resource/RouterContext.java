/**
 * A {@link ServerContext} which is created when a request has been routed. The
 * context includes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the portion of the request URI which matched the URI template
 * <li>a method for obtaining the base URI, which represents the portion of the
 * request URI which has been routed so far. This is obtained dynamically by
 * concatenating the matched URI with matched URIs in parent router contexts
 * <li>a map which contains the parsed URI template variables, keyed on the URI
 * template variable name.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * When a request is routed the request is duplicated and the
 * {@link Request#getResourceName() resource name} trimmed so that it is
 * relative to the current resource being accessed. More specifically, the
 * "relativized" resource name represents the portion of the resource URI which
 * follows the portion matched during routing by the URI template or "" (empty
 * string) if the URI template matched exactly. The matched portion of the
 * resource URI and the base URI may be accessed via this router context.
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Router top = new Router();
 * Router users = new Router();
 * Router devices = new Router();
 * top.addRoute(RoutingMode.STARTS_WITH, &quot;users/{userId}&quot;, users);
 * users.addRouter(RoutingMode.STARTS_WITH, &quot;devices/{deviceId}&quot;, devices);
 * </pre>
 *
 * A request against "users/1" will be routed to the users router with a base
 * URI of "users/1", a matched URI of "users/1", and a resource name of ""
 * (empty string).
 * <p>
 * A request against "users/1/devices/0" will be routed to the users router with
 * a base URI of "users/1", a matched URI of "users/1", and a resource name of
 * "devices/0". It will then be routed to the devices router with a base URI of
 * "users/1/devices/0", a matched URI of "devices/0", and a resource name of ""
 * (empty string).
 * <p>
 * Here is an example of the JSON representation of a routing context:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "id"     : "56f0fb7e-3837-464d-b9ec-9d3b6af665c3",
 *   "class"  : "org.forgerock.json.resource.provider.RouterContext",
 *   "parent" : {
 *       ...
 *   },
 *   "matchedUri" : "users/bjensen",
 *   "uriTemplateVariables" : {
 *       "userId" : "bjensen",
 *       "deviceId" : "0"
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
