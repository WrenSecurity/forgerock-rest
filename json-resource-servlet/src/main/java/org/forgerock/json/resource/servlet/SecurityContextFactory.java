/**
 * An HTTP servlet context factory which will create a {@link SecurityContext}
 * whose authentication ID and authorization ID are taken from attributes
 * contained in the HTTP servlet request.
 * <p>
 * This class provides integration with the common authentication framework and
 * is intended to work as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>An incoming HTTP request is first intercepted by a Servlet filter
 * responsible for authenticating the request.
 * <li>If authentication is successful, the authentication filter determines the
 * set of principals associated with the user which may be required in order to
 * perform authorization. These principals may include the user's unique ID,
 * realm, groups, roles, or LDAP DN, etc.
 * <li>The authentication filter constructs a {@code Map<String, Object>}
 * containing the principals keyed on the principal name. <b>NOTE:</b> various
 * reserved principal names are defined in {@link SecurityContext}.
 * <li>The authentication filter stores the authentication ID (the name which
 * the user identified themselves with during authentication) in the HTTP
 * servlet request's {@link #ATTRIBUTE_AUTHCID} attribute.
 * <li>The authentication filter stores the {@code Map} containing the
 * authorization principals in the HTTP servlet request's
 * {@link #ATTRIBUTE_AUTHZID} attribute.
 * <li>The JSON Resource Servlet uses the {@code SecurityContextFactory} to
 * obtain the authentication ID and authorization principals from the HTTP
 * servlet request's attributes.
 * </ol>
 * The following code illustrates how an authentication Servlet filter can
 * populate the attributes:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) {
 *     // Authenticate the user.
 *     String authcid = getUserName(request);
 *     String password = getPassword(request);
 *
 *     // Add the attributes.
 *     if (checkCredentials(authcid, password)) {
 *         // Obtain principals for authorization.
 *         Map<String, Object> authzid = new HashMap<String, Object>();
 *         authzid.put(AUTHZID_ID, id);
 *         ...
 *
 *         request.setAttribute(ATTRIBUTE_AUTHCID, authcid);
 *         request.setAttribute(ATTRIBUTE_AUTHZID, authzid);
 *     }
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
